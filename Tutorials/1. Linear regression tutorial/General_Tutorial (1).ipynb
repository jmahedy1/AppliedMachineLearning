It does not require a setup and supports many popular machine learning libraries which can be easily loaded in your notebook.\n","1. How to start? Answer: Set up a Google account if you don't already have one, (1) login to your Google account, and go to your Google Drive, (2) click \"New\"->\"More\"->\"Google Colaboratory\". An alternative way: (1) Login to your Google Drive, (2) Open the following URL in your browser: https://colab.research.google.com, (3) Click on the NEW PYTHON 3 NOTEBOOK link at the bottom of the screen.\n","2. How to leverage cloud GPU? Answer: On Menu, click \"Edit\"->\"Notebook Settings\" -> \"Hardware Accelerator\" -> \"GPU\".\n","3. How to run all the cells before the current cell? Answer: On Menu, click \"Runtime\"->\"Run before\". \n","4. How to run the entire code in your notebook without an interruption? Answer: On Menu, click \"Runtime\"->\"Restart and Run all\"\n","5. Any usage requirement? Answer: Ensure to use Colab with a stable internet since it runs on cloud based servers. \n","6. How to save the codes running in Colab? Answer: All the codes are automatically saved on your Google Drive if you are connected to the Internet. You can also click \"File\"-> \"Save a copy in Drive\".\n","7.
